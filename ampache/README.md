# Ampache

This is an example configuration on how to use [Ampache](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/) with Caddy.

The configuration takes following assumptions:

1. You want to use a subdomain for ampache (can be changed obviously).
2. You use domain name `ampache.mydomain.com`.
3. You have caddy files under /home/caddy/


Please be sure to change with your actual values.
